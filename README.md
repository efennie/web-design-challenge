# web-design-challenge

The purpose of this challenge was to showcase past work and highlight web development skills in the process.

The github website that this code launches includes html files for each github webpage as well as all the data and
graphics.

The source of the cities.csv is from OpenWeather APIs, a datasource we used during the python-api-challenge.

The webpages are supposed to have the following functionalities:<br>
    - have a total of 7 pages <br>
    - each page with it's own html file <br>
    - be able to click the graphics and see an expanded version of the chart as well as brief analysis <br>
    - a landing page with links to all the other pages <br>
    - a navbar that can allow you to click through the available pages <br>
    - utilize bootstrap grid to space out containers <br>
    - be adaptable to mobile devices, laptops, and tablets. Keep functionality under different screen sizes <br>

Resources used:
- www.w3schools.com for a lot of help with bootstrap examples, styling sheets, and general organization.<br>
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-render-pandas-dataframe-as-html-table/ for csv to html table conversion.
